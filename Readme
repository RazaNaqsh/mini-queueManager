## Project overview & goals

Goal: Build a small app that accepts background tasks over HTTP, enqueues them via Celery (using Redis as broker & backend), executes them in workers, and exposes status+results.

Minimal feature set:
- Submit a job (e.g., process text, simulate heavy job)
- Get task ID immediately
- Poll task status and result via API
- Run everything with docker-compose (Redis, web, worker)
